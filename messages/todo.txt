Principle:
Every section carries its own message type.
	- Envelope
		- Payload

Envelope:
	- Signed by Node
	- Encrypted Ephemeral-Static
		- Flag: ToLongTerm, ToShortTerm
	- Encrypted Ephemeral:Static-Static
	- Encrypted Ephemeral:Static-Static:Static 
	- Encrypted contains a Nonce to be added to shared secret.

- Encrypted Ephemeral-Static               -> Ephemeral-Static
- Encrypted Ephemeral:Static-Static        -> Ephemeral-Static,  Static-Static
- Encrypted Ephemeral:Static-Static:Static -> Ephemeral-Static1, Static-Static2
